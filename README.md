    <h1>CSES Solutions</h1>

    <p>Welcome to the CSES Solutions repository! This repository contains solutions to the problems from the <a href="https://cses.fi/problemset/">CSES Problem Set</a>.</p>

    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>The CSES Problem Set is a collection of algorithmic problems that are widely used for competitive programming practice. Here, I will share my solutions to these problems, written in various programming languages.</p>

    <h2>Structure</h2>
    <p>The repository is organized as follows:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Each problem has its own directory named after the problem title.</li>
        <li>Inside each directory, you will find the solution to a CSES problem.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How to Use</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Navigate to the problem directory:</strong> Find the problem you are interested in by navigating through the directories.</li>
        <li><strong>View the solution:</strong> Open the solution file to see the code.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Contribution</h2>
    <p>If you find any issues with the solutions or have a more efficient approach, feel free to open a pull request. Contributions are welcome!</p>

    <p>Happy Coding :)</p>
